# Description
Fix CLI inconsistency by changing database setup command structure from single `kanbatte db` command to `kanbatte db setup` command group. Update cli.js lines 86-92 to replace direct command with dbCmd command group containing setup subcommand, and update commands.js line 49 error message to reference correct `kanbatte db setup` syntax to match roadmap specification. The new structure should provide proper help output when running `kanbatte db --help` and error handling when running `kanbatte db` without subcommand.
