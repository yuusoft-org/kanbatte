# Description

currently for the eventlog we are writing directly to the db. which means we need to implement a lot of the event log features from scratch.


try see if we can migrate to  https://github.com/yuusoft-org/insieme

it will make it more easier when we enable collaboration and data sync features as we rely on the library instead of implementing all from scratch
