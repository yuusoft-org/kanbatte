# Iteration 005 - Event Sourcing Architecture Cleanup

**Date**: September 27, 2025
**Status**: Completed
**Development Time**: ~30 minutes

## What Was Fixed

### Proper Event Sourcing Implementation
- **Removed Redundant Table**: Eliminated unused `comments` table
- **Clean Architecture**: Now uses only `event_log` (source of truth) and `task_view` (materialized view)
- **Consistent Pattern**: All data follows event sourcing principles

### Database Structure Cleanup
- **Migration**: Added `0004-remove-comments-table.sql` to clean up schema
- **Final Tables**: `event_log`, `task_view`, `schema_migrations` (3 tables total)
- **Event Log as Source**: All changes recorded as immutable events

## Technical Correction

### Before (Incorrect)
```
event_log     (events)
task_view     (current state)
comments      (redundant - duplicated data)
```

### After (Correct Event Sourcing)
```
event_log     (source of truth - all events)
task_view     (materialized view - current state)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Write**: Command → Event in `event_log` → Update `task_view`
2. **Read**: Query `task_view` directly for performance
3. **History**: Complete audit trail in `event_log`

## Event Types Supported
- `task_created`: New task events
- `task_updated`: Task modification events
- `comment_added`: Comment events

## Architecture Benefits

### Event Sourcing Advantages
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every change preserved forever
- **State Reconstruction**: Can rebuild any state from events
- **Time Travel**: Historical data available
- **Performance**: Fast reads from materialized views

### Clean Implementation
- **Minimal Code**: No redundant data storage
- **Consistent Patterns**: All entities follow same pattern
- **Easy Testing**: Clear separation of concerns

## Database Schema (Final)

### event_log
```sql
CREATE TABLE event_log (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,        -- Event UUID
  key TEXT NOT NULL,          -- Entity key (taskId)
  data BLOB NOT NULL,         -- MessagePack event data
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL -- Unix timestamp
);
```

### task_view
```sql
CREATE TABLE task_view (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,               -- Entity UUID
  key TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- View key (task:id, comment:id)
  data BLOB NOT NULL,                -- MessagePack current state
  last_offset_id TEXT NOT NULL,      -- Last event that updated this
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,       -- Creation timestamp
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL        -- Last update timestamp
);
```

## Files Modified

### Database
- `db/migrations/0004-remove-comments-table.sql`: Clean up migration
- Removed obsolete `0003-add-comments.sql` files

### Code Quality
- DAO already correctly implemented event sourcing
- No code changes needed - architecture was already correct
- Tests continue to pass without modification

## Test Results

### All Systems Working
- Migration tests: 3 migrations executed correctly
- Task CRUD tests: All operations working
- Comment tests: Events and materialized views functioning
- File parser tests: Markdown processing working

### Verified Functionality
```bash
# Complete workflow still works
kanbatte new task -p "Test" -t "Sample task"
kanbatte new comment -i <id> -c "Sample comment"
kanbatte read <id>  # Shows task + comments from materialized view
```

## Event Sourcing Validation

### Event Log (Source of Truth)
- Every action creates immutable event
- Events never modified or deleted
- Complete history preserved

### Task View (Performance)
- Current state computed from events
- Fast queries without event replay
- Can be rebuilt from event log if needed

## Next Steps

Architecture is now clean and ready for:

1. **Followups System**: Add followup events and views
2. **Enhanced Queries**: Complex filtering and search
3. **Event Replay**: Historical state reconstruction
4. **Snapshots**: Performance optimization for large event streams

## Conclusion

Iteration 005 successfully cleaned up the database architecture to follow proper event sourcing principles. The system now has a minimal, consistent implementation where:

- **Event log** serves as the single source of truth
- **Task view** provides performant materialized views
- **All data** follows the same event sourcing pattern

Key achievements:
- Removed redundant data storage
- Maintained full functionality
- Cleaner, more maintainable architecture
- Proper event sourcing implementation
- All tests continue to pass
