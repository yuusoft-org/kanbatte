# Iteration 004 - File-based Tasks & Comments System

**Date**: September 27, 2025
**Status**: Completed
**Development Time**: ~1 hour

## What Was Implemented

### File-based Task Creation
- **New Feature**: `kanbatte new task -f <file.md>`
- **Markdown Parser**: Parses project ID and title from `# ProjectId - Task Title` format
- **Description Extraction**: Converts markdown content to task description
- **Error Handling**: Clear validation for file format and missing files

### Comments System
- **New Command**: `kanbatte new comment -i <taskId> -c "content"`
- **Database Schema**: Added comments table with proper indexing
- **Event Sourcing**: Comments generate events and update task_view
- **Task Integration**: Comments appear when reading tasks

### Enhanced Testing
- **File Parser Tests**: Validation, error handling, missing files
- **Comment Tests**: Creation, retrieval, task association
- **Complete Coverage**: All new functionality tested

## Technical Implementation

### File Parser
```javascript
// Example usage
const taskData = await parseTaskFile('task.md');
// From: # WebApp - Build auth system
// Returns: { projectId: 'WebApp', title: 'Build auth system', description: '...' }
```

### Comments Architecture
- **Event Log**: `comment_added` events preserve audit trail
- **View Storage**: Comments stored in task_view with `comment:id` keys
- **Retrieval**: Filtered by taskId for efficient querying

### Database Migration
- Added `0003-add-comments.sql` migration
- Proper indexes on task_id and created_at
- Down migration for rollback support

## Command Examples

### File-based Task Creation
```bash
# Create markdown file
echo "# WebApp - User Authentication

Implement login system with OAuth" > task.md

# Create task from file
kanbatte new task -f task.md
```

### Comments Workflow
```bash
# Add comment to task
kanbatte new comment -i <taskId> -c "Great progress on this feature"

# View task with comments
kanbatte read <taskId>
# Shows task details + all comments with timestamps
```

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `src/utils/fileParser.js`: New markdown file parsing
- `src/commands.js`: File-based task creation, comment commands
- `src/dao/libsqlDao.js`: Comment CRUD operations
- `src/cli.js`: Wired up new commands and dependencies

### Database
- `db/migrations/0003-add-comments.sql`: Comments table schema
- `db/migrations/down/0003-add-comments.sql`: Rollback migration

### Testing
- `tests/file-parser.test.js`: File parsing validation tests
- `tests/task.test.js`: Comment creation and retrieval tests
- `tests/run-all.js`: Updated test runner

## Test Results

### All Tests Passing
- Migration tests: 3 executed migrations, proper schema
- Task CRUD tests: Including new comment functionality
- File parser tests: Format validation, error handling
- Comment tests: Creation, retrieval, task association

### Workflow Verification
```bash
# File-based task creation
kanbatte new task -f task.md

# Comment addition
kanbatte new comment -i <id> -c "Review needed"

# Integrated view
kanbatte read <id>  # Shows task + comments
```

## Next Steps

Following the roadmap:

1. **Followups System**: Add `kanbatte new followup` functionality
2. **Enhanced Queries**: Better filtering and search options
3. **Task Dependencies**: Link related tasks
4. **Bulk Operations**: Import/export capabilities

## Conclusion

Iteration 004 successfully added file-based task creation and a complete comments system. The implementation maintains the event sourcing architecture while providing practical workflow improvements.

Key achievements:
- Markdown file parsing for task creation
- Full comments system with proper event sourcing
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean CLI integration
- Database schema properly extended

The system now supports rich task discussions and flexible task creation methods, making it more practical for real-world usage.
